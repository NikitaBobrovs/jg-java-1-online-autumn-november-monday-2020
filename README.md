# JavaGuru: Java 1 Online - Autumn - November - Monday - Course Group Repository

Welcome! 👋
This document contains the most important information regarding course.

## Prerequisites ☝️

A power of will and computer! 😉

### Required Tools ⚙️

During the course we extensively use the following software:
 
* **[Intellij IDEA: Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)** - Widely used integrated development environment that helps us to write and run **Java** source code

  * ⚠️ *Note:* Highly recommended installing IDE via **Toolbox** application for convenience
  * [[Download](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/download)]

* **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** - World's leading distribution version control system that helps us to control, manage and share source code

  * [[Download](https://git-scm.com/download)]

* **[JDK: OpenJDK 11 LTS](https://adoptopenjdk.net)** - Special toolkit that contains necessary components for code compilation and execution

  * ⚠️ *Note:* Highly recommended installing JDK via **Intellij IDEA** to avoid complex and inconvenient manual setup process
  * [[Download](https://adoptopenjdk.net)]

## Guidelines 📖

Make sure to follow our guidelines! 😌

### Homework Submission Workflow ⤴️

It is required to submit a solved assignment exercises and problems throughout the course in order to receive a certificate of completion.
Since a repository shared between students, please refer to the following homework submission workflow.

**Initial** steps to take (should be done **once per course** ⚠️):
1. `VCS > Update Project > Merge incoming changes in the current branch` - to make sure your project is up-to-date with repository
2. `VCS > Git > Branches... > + New Branch` with branch name `student-name-surname`, e.g. `student-ivans-ivanovs` - to create your personal working branch

👉 After that, please create your own **package** `name_surname`, e.g. `ivans_ivanovs`, in the `src/main/java/students` folder.
To create a package, right click on the *java* folder and select `New > Package`.

**Subsequent** steps to take (should be done **before every submission** ⚠️):
1. `VCS > Update Project > Merge incoming changes into the current branch`
2. `VCS > Git > Branches... > Local Branches: Master > Update`
3. `VCS > Git > Branches... > Local Branches: Master > Merge into current`

👉 After that, in your own package, create package after lesson name and level `lesson_n/level_n/task_n`, e.g. `lesson_2/level_1/task_1`. Create text files or java classes with solution as needed.

4. `VCS > Commit > Commit and Push...`

### Homework Review Workflow 🔁

Each solution reviewed personally and is either accepted or rejected.

* The comments will appear if there are any remarks or suggestions
* Homework evaluation will be visible at the top of a document with comment:
  * `//Resolution: ACCEPTED` - In case solution accepted
  * `//Resolution: SEEN` - In case solution rejected and requires additional improvements or fixes
